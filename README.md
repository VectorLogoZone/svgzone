[SVG Zone](https://www.svg.zone/icons/) is my site for anything related to SVG.

I'd like to expand it to include other SVG-related things, but thought that it was useful as it is now.

The main thing that is in the works is a search engine for SVG icons that are stored in public repositories on Github.

## Running

Currently just a Jekyll site, so: `jekyll serve`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

If you just want to add a new repo that has SVG icons, just submit an [issue](https://github.com/VectorLogoZone/svgzone/issues/new) with the URL.

For larger changes, please follow the standard Github [Fork & Pull Request Workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

## License

The website is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE.txt).

The icons themselves retain the licenses granted by their original owners. Each images links back to the source repository on Github which (hopefully) contains the license.
